CHANGELOG
I have added sorting and filtering to organize dishes by name, price, or course type. A new Delete function now allows users to remove dishes with a simple tap, while the improved Edit function allows for full menu item. Added a logo on both screens, with a complete redesign of the UI for improved card layouts, intuitive controls, and better navigation. The app now offers a better menu management efficient and user-friendly.
